# Step-by-Step Render Deployment Guide
## Deploy Second Support from Replit to Render

Follow this guide exactly to deploy your accounting platform from Replit to Render with PostgreSQL.

---

## STEP 1: Export Your Project from Replit

### 1.1 Download Project Files
1. In your Replit project, click the **three dots menu (⋯)** in the top-right
2. Select **"Download as ZIP"**
3. Save the ZIP file to your computer
4. Extract the ZIP file to a folder (e.g., `second-support-accounting`)

### 1.2 Clean Up Downloaded Files
Open the extracted folder and:
- Delete `.replit` file (if present)
- Delete `replit.nix` file (if present)
- Keep all other files including `render.yaml`

---

## STEP 2: Upload to GitHub

### 2.1 Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the **green "New"** button or **"+"** → **"New repository"**
3. Repository settings:
   - **Repository name**: `second-support-accounting`
   - **Description**: "Second Support Accounting Platform"
   - **Visibility**: Public (required for Render free tier)
   - **Don't check** "Add a README file"
   - **Don't check** "Add .gitignore"
   - **Don't check** "Choose a license"
4. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2.2 Upload Files to GitHub
**Method A: Web Interface (Easier)**
1. In your new GitHub repository, click **"uploading an existing file"**
2. Drag and drop ALL files from your extracted folder
3. In the commit message box, type: `Initial commit from Replit`
4. Click **"Commit changes"**

**Method B: Command Line**
```bash
cd path/to/your/extracted/folder
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit from Replit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/second-support-accounting.git
git push -u origin main
```

## STEP 3: Create Render Account

### 3.1 Sign Up for Render
1. Go to [render.com](https://render.com)
2. Click **"Get Started for Free"**
3. Choose **"Sign up with GitHub"** (recommended)
4. Authorize Render to access your GitHub account
5. Complete your profile setup

---

## STEP 4: Deploy Using Blueprint (One-Click Method)

### 4.1 Create New Service
1. In Render dashboard, click **"New +"**
2. Select **"Blueprint"**
3. Connect your GitHub repository:
   - Click **"Connect account"** if not connected
   - Select your `second-support-accounting` repository
   - Leave branch as `main`

### 4.2 Configure Blueprint
1. Render will read your `render.yaml` file automatically
2. You'll see two services being created:
   - **Web Service**: `second-support-accounting`
   - **PostgreSQL Database**: `second-support-db`
3. Review the configuration and click **"Apply"**

### 4.3 Wait for Deployment
- Database creation: ~2-3 minutes
- App deployment: ~5-10 minutes
- Watch the logs for any errors

---

## STEP 5: Generate Secure Session Secret

### 5.1 Create Session Secret
Open terminal/command prompt and run:
```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```
Copy the output (it will look like: `a1b2c3d4e5f6...`)

### 5.2 Update Environment Variables
1. Go to your **web service** (not database) in Render dashboard
2. Click **"Environment"** in the left sidebar
3. Find the `SESSION_SECRET` variable
4. Replace the auto-generated value with your secure secret
5. Click **"Save Changes"**

---

## STEP 6: Verify Deployment

### 6.1 Check Service Status
1. In Render dashboard, both services should show **"Live"** status
2. If there are errors, check the **"Logs"** tab for details

### 6.2 Access Your Application
1. Click on your web service
2. Find the **URL** (looks like: `https://second-support-accounting.onrender.com`)
3. Click the URL to open your application
4. You should see the VoM login page

---

## STEP 7: Create Demo User

### 7.1 Access Database Console
1. In Render dashboard, click on your **PostgreSQL database service**
2. Click **"Connect"** in the left sidebar
3. Copy the **"PSQL Command"**
4. Open terminal and paste the command to connect

### 7.2 Create Demo User
In the database console, run this command:
```sql
INSERT INTO company_users (id, email, password, company_id, company_name, first_name, last_name, is_active) 
VALUES ('demo-user-123', 'demo@company.com', '$2b$10$P9ENS6lzhMYXn/j3aY0G4env.xQ6w2HTUe2NULY0w7yScHyYICjxe', 'vomcompany', 'VoM Company', 'Demo', 'User', true);
```

### 7.3 Test Login
1. Go back to your application URL
2. Login with:
   - **Email**: `demo@company.com`
   - **Password**: `demo123`
3. You should successfully access the dashboard

---

## STEP 8: Verify All Features

### 8.1 Test Core Functionality
After logging in, test:
- ✅ Dashboard loads with statistics
- ✅ Navigate to Customers page
- ✅ Navigate to Products/Services page
- ✅ Navigate to Invoices page
- ✅ Navigate to Quotations page
- ✅ Create a test customer
- ✅ Create a test product
- ✅ Logout and login again

---

## STEP 9: Production Optimization (Optional)

### 9.1 Custom Domain
1. In your web service → **"Settings"** → **"Custom Domains"**
2. Add your domain (e.g., `app.yourcompany.com`)
3. Update your DNS records as instructed
4. Render provides free SSL certificates

### 9.2 Monitoring
1. Set up health check monitoring
2. Configure notification alerts
3. Review performance metrics

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Build Fails
**Solution:**
1. Check build logs in Render dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Verify build command is correct: `npm install && npm run build`

### Issue: Database Connection Error
**Solution:**
1. Verify PostgreSQL service is running
2. Check that `DATABASE_URL` is properly set in web service environment
3. Ensure both services are in the same region

### Issue: Login Doesn't Work
**Solution:**
1. Verify demo user was created in database
2. Check `SESSION_SECRET` is set properly
3. Look at application logs for authentication errors

### Issue: App Shows "Service Unavailable"
**Solution:**
1. Check if web service is "Live"
2. Review deployment logs for errors
3. Verify start command is correct: `npm start`

### Issue: Slow Loading (Free Tier)
**Explanation:**
- Free tier services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- First request after inactivity takes ~30 seconds to wake up
- Consider upgrading to paid plan for always-on service

---

## Cost Summary

### Free Tier Limitations:
- Services spin down after 15 minutes of inactivity
- 750 hours/month total across all services
- PostgreSQL has storage limits

### Paid Plan Costs:
- **Web Service**: $7/month (Starter plan)
- **PostgreSQL**: $7/month (Starter plan)
- **Total**: $14/month for production deployment

## Environment Variables Reference

Your application will automatically have these set:

**Auto-generated by Render:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
- `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` - Your app's public URL
- `PORT` - Port number (usually 10000)

**You need to set:**
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Your secure random string
