# Second Support Dashboard

## Overview

Second Support Dashboard is a complete business management web application that provides a professional interface for customer management, quotation system, and secure user authentication. The project features comprehensive customer management forms, quotation handling, hierarchical navigation with Sales dropdown menu, and a robust authentication system with PostgreSQL database integration and session management.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology**: Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla web technologies)
- **Layout**: Fixed sidebar with main content area design pattern
- **Styling**: Embedded CSS with modern design principles using system fonts
- **Responsive Design**: Basic viewport meta tag configuration for mobile compatibility

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Python's built-in HTTP server (`python -m http.server`)
- **Port**: Runs on port 5000
- **Architecture**: Static file serving only - no dynamic backend processing
- **Runtime**: Supports both Node.js 20 and Python 3.11 environments

## Key Components

### User Interface Components
1. **Sidebar Navigation**
   - Fixed width (250px) sidebar with white background
   - User profile section with avatar component
   - Shadow effects for visual depth
   - Scroll capability for overflow content

2. **User Profile Section**
   - Circular avatar component (40px diameter)
   - Dark background with white text
   - Positioned at top of sidebar with border separation

3. **Layout System**
   - Flexbox-based layout structure
   - Full viewport height utilization
   - Modern CSS reset for consistent cross-browser rendering

## Data Flow

Currently, the application operates as a static frontend with no data persistence or API integration. All content is hardcoded in the HTML structure. Future iterations may require:
- API integration for dynamic content
- State management for user interactions
- Database connectivity for data persistence

## External Dependencies

### Development Dependencies
- Python 3.11 (for local development server)
- Node.js 20 (available but not currently utilized)
- No external JavaScript libraries or frameworks
- No CSS frameworks or preprocessors

### Browser Requirements
- Modern browsers supporting CSS Flexbox
- CSS3 support for advanced styling features
- Standard HTML5 compatibility

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- Uses Python's built-in HTTP server for local development
- Configured to run on port 5000
- Replit workflow automation for easy startup
- Parallel workflow execution capability

### Production Considerations
- Currently suitable for static hosting platforms
- No build process required
- Can be deployed to any web server supporting static files
- Future scalability may require proper web server configuration
