# replit.md

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built with React (frontend) and Express.js (backend), featuring a comprehensive authentication system that supports both Replit OAuth and company user login. The application is designed as a company dashboard system with internationalization support (English/Arabic) and modern UI components.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and building
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Internationalization**: Custom i18n system supporting English and Arabic (RTL)

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Dual authentication system:
  - Replit OAuth (OpenID Connect) for Replit users
  - Company user system with bcrypt password hashing
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage
- **Security**: reCAPTCHA integration for bot protection

### Database Design
- **ORM**: Drizzle with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Key Tables**:
  - `sessions`: Required for Replit Auth session storage
  - `users`: Replit OAuth users (mandatory for Replit Auth)
  - `company_users`: Company-specific user accounts
  - `password_reset_tokens`: Password reset functionality

## Key Components

### Authentication System
The application implements a dual authentication approach:

1. **Replit OAuth**: Integrated OpenID Connect flow for Replit platform users
2. **Company Login**: Traditional email/password authentication for company users

**Rationale**: This design allows the application to serve both Replit platform users and external company users, providing flexibility for different user types while maintaining security standards.

### UI Component System
- **Design System**: Shadcn/ui with "new-york" style variant
- **Theme**: Neutral color palette with CSS custom properties
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Accessibility**: Built on Radix UI primitives for WCAG compliance

### Internationalization
- **Languages**: English (LTR) and Arabic (RTL)
- **Implementation**: Custom translation system with dynamic language switching
- **Layout**: Automatic direction switching based on selected language

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   - User selects authentication method (Replit OAuth or Company Login)
   - Credentials validated against respective systems
   - Session established with PostgreSQL storage
   - User redirected to authenticated dashboard

2. **Company User Flow**:
   - Login with email/password + reCAPTCHA
   - Password reset via email tokens
   - Session-based authentication state

3. **Data Fetching**:
   - TanStack Query manages all server state
   - Automatic error handling for 401 responses
   - Optimistic updates where appropriate

## External Dependencies

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL provider
- **Connection**: WebSocket-based connection for serverless compatibility

### Security Services
- **reCAPTCHA**: Google reCAPTCHA v2 for bot protection
- **bcrypt**: Password hashing for company users

### UI Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Unstyled, accessible UI primitives
- **Lucide React**: Icon library
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework

### Development Tools
- **ESBuild**: Fast bundling for production
- **TSX**: TypeScript execution for development
- **Replit Integration**: Cartographer plugin for Replit environment

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Server**: Node.js with TSX for hot reloading
- **Client**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations with push command

### Production
- **Build Process**: 
  1. Vite builds client assets to `dist/public`
  2. ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Static Assets**: Served by Express in production
- **Environment**: Node.js with PostgreSQL connection

### Configuration
- **Environment Variables**: 
  - `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
  - `SESSION_SECRET`: Session encryption key
  - `REPL_ID`: Replit environment identifier
  - `RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY`: reCAPTCHA server key
